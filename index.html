      <div class="paragraph" id="dom-elem-13"></div>
      <p>I've worked in product management, software engineering, management consulting and more. I've had my own startup and supported a handful more.</p>
      <p>I've always felt in my element during the design phase.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span>Here's a sample of things I've worked on.</span>

          <h1 class="heading project-title">Lantern</h1>
          <p>71% of people are "disengaged" at work.</p>
          <p>Lantern hopes to inspire people to consider other options. Users share short videos about what their work is like, and by doing so, help each other learn about what jobs are out there.</p>
          <p>It will also incorporate a peer-to-peer approach to hiring and mentoring.</p>
          <p>It's a little like an evolution of&nbsp;glassdoor.com.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>So far, I have developed rough wireframes to get the development team started. I am currently thinking about the visual identity.</p>

          <p>
            <span>Why do we use messaging apps? To send messages? No, we use them stay connected to the groups of people in our life.</span>
          </p>
          <p>So, what if we build an experience that uses groups as the primary organizing principle? Designed to allow us to connect in all sorts of different ways, not just text.</p>

          <h1 class="heading project-title">Chat heads</h1>
          <p>Disclaimer: I did not do the visual design. Or the name.</p>
          <p>I was early on the Paper team (doing iOS work). We were discussing how to implement messaging.</p>
          <p>My point to the team was: if somebody wants to chat with you, then why not just have them show up on screen? Why not just display actually what is happening, rather than an abstract thing like a red notification number.

          <h3 class="heading project-title">Instant Personalization</h3>
          <p>Instant Personalization was an interesting landmark in the growth of Facebook platform.</p>
          <p>Ultimately ill-fated, it would automatically personalize users' experiences when landing on websites such as yelp.</p>
          <p>One of the key design questions was how to inform users about what was happening when they arrived on a partner site. I designed this "bar" that slid down upon arrival on the site.</p>
          <p>(Unfortunately, too many people clicked "No Thanks", but I feel the program helped move the conversation forward about the value of personalizing websites)</p>

          <p>When living in London, I became intrigued with the idea of ordering food and drink by SMS.</p>
          <p>I had no experience in design or software engineering, but over the course of 3 months I built a prototype system.</p>
          <p>User would send an SMS with their order, and it would appear on a POS device that we built ourselves - both hardware and software.</p>
